# Dashboard-pronote
Wanna do your academic comeback but you're not organized asf, this ai/webscrapping powered app will help get better by getting itself better and better with time (machine learning ðŸ˜‰)

app/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                 # Main file to run the application
â”œâ”€â”€ auth.py                 # Handles authentication (e.g., login)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py                # Utility functions (e.g., human typing, event comparison)
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.py 
â”œâ”€â”€ calendar_utils.py       # Calendar creation and manipulation functions
â”œâ”€â”€ html_parsing.py         # HTML parsing and data extraction
â””â”€â”€ config.json             # Configuration file for credentials



Things done:
    -- CrÃ©er un bot selenium et se loger sur pronote pour rÃ©cupÃ©rer le fichier html ==> auth.py & utils.py
    --parsing the html files to get the datas of ds ==> html_parsing.py
    -- using the parsed data to create a calendar file ==> calendar.ics
    --having a website to see all the datas ==> dashboard.py


things to get done:
    - webscrap evaluation(id_70) and ds (id_69) (both) and store in the same place DONEâœ…
    - being able to add new ds events, will also be stored in that same place âœ… but new ds stored manually are not shown if app is restarted ==> problem solved succesfully âœ…
        ==> sidebar (add new events, scroll) + collonms in dashboardâœ…
        - champs Ã  remplir:âœ…
            -type âœ…
            - when ?âœ…
            -titleâœ…
            -whereâœ…
            - + add a date sorting in the dictionnary when added in it (new events should not be added at end but in function of time) ==>done âœ…
